In this class, we practiced how to make an AJAX POST request using jQuery and PHP.
First, we disabled the form from completing its default action. Then, we serialized
the form and sent it to the server. The server-side PHP formatted the data and sent
back an HTML fragment. This fragment was then inserted into the DOM using jQuery.

We also began using JSON which will be elaborated upon in the next class.

The `html_example` directory has the **complete** HTML AJAX examples. The 
`json_example` directory has what we were able to complete by the end of the class;
the remainder of this example will complete on Wednesday.
